# Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)

[DRA](https://github.com/kubernetes/dynamic-resource-allocation/) is Dynamic
Resource Allocation for Kubernetes, enabling flexible device allocation with
structured parameters and topology awareness.

For GPU-specific sharing choices across HAMi, MIG, MPS, vGPU, and DRA, see
[HAMi / MIG / GPU Sharing](./hami-gpu-sharing.md).

## Overview

DRA provides a more flexible alternative to the traditional device plugin
framework, supporting:

- Complex device requirements (GPU + NIC + storage combinations)
- Topology-aware scheduling (NUMA, NVLink, InfiniBand)
- Structured parameters for fine-grained device configuration
- Multiple device types per pod

## Architecture View of DRA KEPs

DRA is now more than a claim allocation API. The active KEPs are best read as a
set of connected control loops: workload intent, API state, scheduler fit,
node-side preparation, and feedback for applications and operators.

![DRA KEP architecture](../../diagrams/dra-kep-architecture.svg)

The diagram keeps the KEPs in architecture lanes instead of release-order
lists:

- **Request surface**: Workload-level claims, extended resource compatibility,
  and AdminAccess determine who can ask for DRA resources and how migration
  from Device Plugins can happen.
- **API state**: ResourceClaim status, Pod status, Downward API, and
  availability summaries make the allocation observable after scheduling.
- **Scheduling and binding**: Prioritized alternatives, binding conditions,
  taints, typed attributes, consumable capacity, and native resources define
  how the scheduler decides whether a claim can fit.
- **Node and driver loop**: DRA drivers publish ResourceSlices, prepare devices
  through kubelet, and expose the result through PodResources, CDI, NRI, and
  driver-specific hooks.
- **Operations feedback**: Health, topology, capacity, and claim status close
  the loop for debugging, autoscaling, and capacity planning.

# NVIDIA GPU DRA

Two DRA kubelet plugins: gpu-kubelet-plugin, compute-domain-kubelet-plugin are required.
NVIDIA GB200 is supported.
In the future, this driver will be included in the NVIDIA GPU Operator

Requirements:

- Kubernetes v1.32 or newer.
- Enable CDI in container runtime(containerd 2.0 enabled by default).
- NVIDIA GPU Driver 565 or later. The GPU driver installation must include the nvidia-imex and nvidia-imex-ctl binaries.
- installing GPU Operator v25.3.x or later.

## Recent Upstream Release Notes

The fastest way to understand how DRA is evolving is to read the release blogs
as a progression from "better API surface" to "real production control loop":

| Release | Main signal | Why AI infra teams should care |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [v1.33 DRA updates](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/01/kubernetes-v1-33-dra-updates/) | DRA keeps maturing while still in beta; driver-owned claim status improves and new alpha work starts around prioritized alternatives, device taints, and admin access. | This is where DRA starts moving beyond "device count" and toward operator workflows and richer status. |
| [v1.34 DRA gets even more powerful](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/09/01/kubernetes-v1-34-dra-updates/) | Core DRA reaches GA and adds stronger operational pieces such as AdminAccess, PodResources visibility, extended-resource migration, consumable capacity, binding conditions, and resource health. | This is the first release where production migration planning from Device Plugin to DRA becomes realistic. |
| [v1.36: More Drivers, New Features, and the Next Era of DRA](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/05/07/kubernetes-v1-36-dra-136-updates/) | DRA expands across more drivers and adds workload-level claims, native resource experiments, better resource-pool visibility, deterministic selection, and discoverable device metadata. | The scope clearly broadens from GPUs into NICs, CPU, memory, and larger workload orchestration. |
| [v1.37 AI Infra release notes](./sig-release/v1.37/release.md) | Extended Resources, device taints, and claim device status reach GA; workload-level claims and the shared/partitioned device path reach Beta. | DRA now has a practical legacy-workload migration path and a direct bridge into Workload-Aware Scheduling. |

  This note now also folds in the 2026-05-07 official DRA follow-up.

## v1.36 Feature Snapshot for AI Infra

The 2026-05-07 upstream DRA blog is useful because it groups the v1.36 changes
into two buckets: features that materially improve day-2 operations today, and
features that open the next wave of platform design.

### Production-oriented improvements

- **Prioritized list (Stable)**: lets a claim express ordered fallback
  preferences such as "H100 first, then A100", improving scarce-accelerator
  utilization.
- **Extended resource support (Beta)**: lets existing
  `vendor.com/device: N`-style workloads migrate gradually while the backend
  allocation path moves to DRA.
- **Partitionable devices (Beta)**: models MIG-like or other logical slices as
  native DRA behavior instead of pre-carving everything statically.
- **Device taints and tolerations (Beta)**: isolates faulty or reserved
  devices without draining an entire node.
- **Device binding conditions (Beta)**: avoids binding Pods before attachable
  or fabric-backed devices are actually prepared.
- **Resource health status (Beta)**: exposes device health in Pod status for
  faster fault attribution and controller-driven remediation.

### New directions worth lab validation

- **ResourceClaim support for workloads (Alpha)**: moves claim sharing from
  single Pods toward PodGroup or workload-level semantics for large distributed
  jobs.
- **Node allocatable resources (Alpha)**: starts exploring DRA as the control
  plane for CPU and memory placement, not only external accelerators.
- **DRA resource availability visibility (Alpha)**: introduces point-in-time
  resource-pool capacity snapshots for dashboards and capacity planning.
- **List types for attributes**: improves CEL matching when device attributes
  are sets instead of single scalar values.
- **Deterministic device selection**: scheduler ordering becomes predictable,
  which gives driver authors more influence over final placement quality.
- **Discoverable device metadata in containers**: standardizes how drivers
  surface attributes like PCI addresses and network configuration into
  containers without extra API calls.

## v1.37 Feature Snapshot for AI Infra

Kubernetes v1.37 shifts the DRA discussion from "can a claim allocate a GPU?"
to migration, fault isolation, device preparation, sharing, and workload-level
lifecycle management.

### Stable migration and operations path

- **Extended Resources via DRA (GA, KEP-5004)**: existing
  `vendor.com/device: N` workloads can keep their Pod spec while a DeviceClass
  routes allocation to a DRA driver. A cluster may migrate node pools
  gradually, but the same resource name cannot be backed by Device Plugin and
  DRA on the same node.
- **Device Taints and Tolerations (GA, KEP-5055)**: isolate an unhealthy or
  maintenance-bound device without removing the entire node from service.
- **ResourceClaim Device Status (GA, KEP-4817)**: drivers publish allocation
  status and standardized network data into the claim.
- **Standard `resource.kubernetes.io/numaNode` attribute (Stable, KEP-6072)**:
  gives independent GPU, NIC, and accelerator drivers a common NUMA topology
  vocabulary.

### Beta allocation chain

- **ResourceClaim support for workloads (KEP-5729)**: one PodGroup can own and
  share a generated claim, avoiding per-Pod claim duplication and the
  `reservedFor` cardinality limit.
- **Consumable Capacity (KEP-5075)** and **Partitionable Devices (KEP-4815)**:
  cover capacity sharing and logical partitions for GPUs, NICs, and other
  structured devices.
- **Device Binding Conditions (KEP-5007)**: delays Pod binding until an
  external device is ready and permits rescheduling after failure or timeout.
- **Device Attributes Downward API (KEP-5304)**: carries driver-generated
  metadata such as PCI addresses or MACs into containers through CDI metadata.

The v1.37 release materials are not fully consistent yet for **Resource Health
Status (KEP-4680)**: the release branch still marks it Beta and enabled by
default, while a release announcement draft listed it as Stable. Verify the
final v1.37 CHANGELOG and feature-gate definitions before documenting it as GA.

### DRA + Workload-Aware Scheduling

The important v1.37 integration point is not merely that Pods can consume DRA;
it is that the PodGroup lifecycle can own a shared claim. This lets a gang of
training workers or a disaggregated inference group reserve a topology unit,
RDMA interface, partition, or shared capacity once and release it with the
group.

The two main gates remain opt-in in v1.37:

- `GenericWorkload` (Beta, default off) enables the Workload/PodGroup core,
  gang scheduling, and workload-aware preemption.
- `DRAWorkloadResourceClaims` (Beta, default off) enables PodGroup-level shared
  ResourceClaims across API server, controller manager, scheduler, and kubelet.

See [Kubernetes v1.37 DRA and WAS release notes](./sig-release/v1.37/release.md)
for the complete gate matrix, upgrade risks, and recommended rollout order.

## Topology Management with DRA

DRA enables sophisticated topology-aware scheduling through device attributes
and constraints. This is essential for AI workloads that require GPU + NIC
coordination on the same PCIe fabric.

### How DRA Handles Topology

DRA uses **attributes** and **constraints** with CEL (Common Expression
Language) to express topology requirements:

1. **Device Attributes**: Each device publishes topology information
   - `pcieRoot`: PCIe hierarchy identifier
   - `numaNode`: NUMA node association
   - `nvlinkDomain`: NVLink fabric identifier
   - `rdmaDevice`: Associated RDMA NIC

2. **Constraints**: CEL expressions that enforce topology rules
   - Same PCIe root for GPU and NIC
   - Same NUMA node for CPU and memory
   - NVLink connectivity between GPUs

3. **SharedID**: Devices on the same topology domain get a shared identifier

### GPU + NIC Topology Coordination

The most powerful use case is coordinating GPU and NIC allocation on the same
PCIe root. This is critical for RDMA-based distributed training with
GPU-Direct.

```yaml
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ResourceClaimTemplate
metadata:
  name: gpu-nic-topology
spec:
  spec:
    devices:
      requests:
      - name: gpu
        deviceClassName: nvidia-gpu
        count: 1
      - name: rdma-nic
        deviceClassName: rdma-nic
        count: 1
      constraints:
      # GPU and NIC must be on the same PCIe root
      - requests: ["gpu", "rdma-nic"]
        matchAttribute: pcieRoot
```

### Integration with Kueue and DRANET

[DRANET](https://github.com/google/dranet) integrates with Kueue's
topology-aware scheduling using node labels:

```yaml
# Topology labels used by Kueue and DRANET
cloud.google.com/gce-topology-block
cloud.google.com/gce-topology-subblock
cloud.google.com/gce-topology-host
kubernetes.io/hostname
```

### DRA Consumable Capacity

A new feature enabling flexible resource sharing while maintaining topology
awareness. It was introduced after the structured-parameters work and is
tracked as [KEP-5075](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/5075).

- **Allow multiple allocations** over multiple resource requests
- **Consumable capacity** - Guaranteed resource sharing

**Use Cases:**

- Virtual GPU Memory Partitioning
- Virtual NIC (vNIC) Sharing
- Bandwidth-limited Network Allocation
- I/O Bandwidth Smart Storage Device Sharing

#### What changed in practice (KEP-5075)

Compared with earlier DRA device sharing, Kubernetes 1.34 adds more concrete
sharing semantics for real multi-tenant use:

- **Cross-claim sharing**: one device (or partition) can be shared by multiple
  ResourceClaims or DeviceRequests when driver enables
  `allowMultipleAllocations`.
- **Capacity-aware scheduling**: scheduler tracks per-device `capacity` usage
  and prevents over-allocation.
- **DistinctAttribute constraint**: the opposite of `matchAttribute`, used to
  ensure request results come from different resources.
- **ShareID in allocation status**: driver can distinguish multiple shared
  allocations on the same underlying device.

Feature gate to enable on control plane and node components:

```bash
--feature-gates=...,DRAConsumableCapacity=true
```

Driver-side ResourceSlice example (memory as consumable capacity):

```yaml
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1
kind: ResourceSlice
spec:
  devices:
  - name: gpu0
    allowMultipleAllocations: true
    capacity:
      memory:
        value: 40Gi
        requestPolicy:
          default: 5Gi
          validRange:
            min: 5Gi
            step: 5Gi
```

Consumer-side request example:

```yaml
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1
kind: ResourceClaim
spec:
  devices:
    requests:
    - name: req0
      exactly:
      - deviceClassName: resource.example.com
        capacity:
          requests:
            memory: 10Gi
      selectors:
      - cel:
          expression: device.allowMultipleAllocations == true
```

Use `distinctAttribute` when requests must not land on the same underlying
device (for example different subnets or fault domains).

### Migration from Device Plugin to DRA

Many organizations have significant investments in Device Plugin-based
solutions. Migrating to DRA presents challenges:

Compatibility flow for DRA-backed extended resources:

![DRA-backed extended resource flow](../../diagrams/dra-extended-resource-flow.svg)

Editable source:
[dra-extended-resource-flow.mmd](../../diagrams/dra-extended-resource-flow.mmd)

**Coexistence Problems:**

- **Resource conflicts**: Same device managed by both systems
- **Topology inconsistency**: Different topology views between systems
- **Scheduling confusion**: Scheduler doesn't have unified view

**Feature Gaps:**

- Device health monitoring (Device Plugin has built-in health checks)
- Hot-plug support (Device Plugin supports dynamic device addition)
- Metrics integration (Prometheus metrics from Device Plugins)

**Recommended Migration Path:**

1. Deploy DRA driver alongside existing Device Plugin
2. Use node taints to partition workloads
3. Gradually migrate workloads to DRA-based resource claims
4. Phase out Device Plugin once all workloads migrated

**DRA Extension Capabilities:**

- DRA drivers can implement compatibility layers
- NVIDIA's DRA driver supports Device Plugin migration path
- NRI integration can bridge runtime-level gaps

  Operator</a> in future releases
- Provides migration path from traditional device plugin to DRA

**See also:** [NVIDIA GPU Operator](./nvidia-gpu-operator.md) for comprehensive
coverage of NVIDIA GPU management in Kubernetes.

### DRA Driver for CPU Resources

<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/dra-driver-cpu">**DRA Driver for
CPU Resources**</a> is a reference implementation of DRA for managing CPU
resources on Kubernetes nodes.

**Architecture:**

The driver is deployed as a DaemonSet with two core components:

- **DRA driver**: Discovers CPU topology and reports available CPUs as
  allocatable resources via `ResourceSlice` objects. Generates CDI (Container
  Device Interface) specifications for CPU set assignment.
- **NRI Plugin**: Integrates with container runtime via Node Resource Interface
  (NRI) to enforce CPU pinning and manage shared CPU pools.

**Key Features:**

- Exclusive CPU allocation for guaranteed pods requesting CPUs via
  ResourceClaim
- Shared CPU pool management for containers without ResourceClaim
- Dynamic CPU pool updates as guaranteed containers are created or removed
- System CPU reservation via `--reserved-cpus` flag (aligns with kubelet's
  static CPU Manager policy)
- State synchronization on daemonset restart to handle existing pod allocations

**Configuration:**

The driver supports `--reserved-cpus` flag to specify CPUs reserved for system
and kubelet processes (similar to kubelet's `reservedSystemCPUs` setting).

**CPU Micro-Topology Support:**

Recent development ([PR #16](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/dra-driver-cpu/pull/16))
adds CPU micro-topology support including:

- NUMA-aware CPU allocation
- CPU pinning with topology alignment
- Coordination with GPU NUMA placement

**Current Limitations:**

- CPU resources only; memory management not supported
