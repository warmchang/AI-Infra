# Kubernetes for AI Infrastructure

Comprehensive guides for running AI workloads on Kubernetes, covering
container lifecycle, scheduling optimization, resource management, and
workload isolation.

## Learning Path

### Getting Started

- **[Kubernetes Learning Plan](./learning-plan.md)**: Structured 3-phase
  approach covering Docker basics, core Kubernetes concepts, and cloud-native
  ecosystem tools

### Core Concepts

- **[Pod Lifecycle](./pod-lifecycle.md)**: Understanding pod creation,
  scheduling, startup, and termination flows with detailed diagrams
- **[Pod Startup Speed Optimization](./pod-startup-speed.md)**: Strategies
  for accelerating pod startup including image optimization, scheduling
  improvements, and GPU workload considerations

### Advanced Topics

#### Scheduling and Resource Management

- **[Scheduling Optimization](./scheduling-optimization.md)**: Comprehensive
  guide covering high-throughput scheduling, multi-scheduler patterns,
  native workload-aware scheduling, gang scheduling, topology-aware
  scheduling, load balancing, and descheduling strategies
- **[TAS Validation Report](./tas-validation.md)**: Topology-aware scheduling
  validation plan, A/B experiment checklist, strategy matrix, and next-stage
  decision gates for AI workloads
- **[Swap Memory Management](./swap-memory-management.md)**: Practical guide to
  kubelet swap behaviors (`NoSwap`/`LimitedSwap`), observability, and memory
  pressure tuning in Kubernetes
- **[Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)](./dra.md)**: Flexible device
  allocation with structured parameters and topology awareness
- **[DRA Driver Feature Matrix](./dra-driver-feature-matrix.md)**: Public DRA
  implementation ecosystem mapped to explicit Beta / GA feature signals,
  active WIP, and current public gaps
- **[NVIDIA GPU Operator](./nvidia-gpu-operator.md)**: Automated GPU driver
  installation, device plugin deployment, DRA driver integration, and GPU
  monitoring with DCGM
- **[HAMi / MIG / GPU Sharing](./hami-gpu-sharing.md)**: Systematic guide to
  GPU partition, time-sharing, and isolation — HAMi, MIG, MPS, vGPU, DRA
  selection matrices, dynamic MIG trade-offs, and queue integration
- **[NVIDIA AI Cluster Runtime (AICR)](./nvidia-aicr.md)**: CLI tooling for
  generating optimized, validated, and reproducible GPU-accelerated Kubernetes
  cluster recipes across EKS, GKE, and self-managed clusters
- **[GPU Fault Detection and Self-Healing](./gpu-fault-detection.md)**:
  Comprehensive guide to detecting, diagnosing, and automatically recovering
  from GPU failures with DCGM, Node Problem Detector, and progressive
  remediation strategies
- **[Node Resource Interface (NRI)](./nri.md)**: Fine-grained container
  resource management at the runtime level
- **[Kubernetes v1.36 AI Infra Highlights](./v1.36-ai-infra-highlights.md)**:
  Curated v1.36 release signals focused on AI infrastructure relevance,
  upgrade risks, and recommended actions

#### Workload Isolation

- **[Isolation Guide](./isolation.md)**: Comprehensive coverage of workload
  isolation techniques including cgroups, security contexts, user namespaces,
  VM-based isolation (Kata Containers, gVisor), and checkpoint/restore for
  AI workloads

#### Scalability and Large-Scale Clusters

- **[Large-Scale Clusters](./large-scale-clusters.md)**: Technologies and
  architectural patterns for running massive Kubernetes clusters (130,000+
  nodes), including Consistent Reads from Cache (KEP-2340), Snapshottable
  API Server Cache (KEP-4988), DRANET, Spanner, and Lustre distributed
  file system

## Quick Reference

### For Scheduling Engineers

1. Start with [Scheduling Optimization](./scheduling-optimization.md) for
   production patterns
2. Review [TAS Validation](./tas-validation.md) when evaluating topology-aware
   scheduling for training, inference, or `GPU + NIC` workloads
3. Review [DRA](./dra.md), [NVIDIA GPU Operator](./nvidia-gpu-operator.md),
   and [HAMi / GPU Sharing](./hami-gpu-sharing.md) for GPU resource management
4. Explore [NRI](./nri.md) for fine-grained container control
5. Understand [Pod Lifecycle](./pod-lifecycle.md) for debugging
6. Use [Swap Memory Management](./swap-memory-management.md) when tuning
   kubelet behavior under memory pressure

### For Platform Engineers

1. Begin with [Kubernetes Learning Plan](./learning-plan.md) for foundational
   knowledge

   full GPUs, MIG, time-slicing, MPS, vGPU, HAMi, and DRA-backed devices
4. Use [NVIDIA AICR](./nvidia-aicr.md) for validated, reproducible cluster
   recipes on EKS, GKE, or self-managed clusters
