# Training on Kubernetes

## Overview

Training large-scale AI models on Kubernetes introduces unique challenges,
particularly around fault tolerance, diagnostics, and maintaining high
effective training time ratios (ETTR). As training clusters scale up, the
frequency and impact of failures increase significantly, making robust
fault handling mechanisms essential.

More details about specific topics:

  Ecosystem](./transformers.md)

  XPU)](./pytorch-ecosystem.md)

  Llama4)](./pre-training.md)

  Parallel)](./parallelism.md)

### Key Challenges at Scale

The expansion of resource scale brings widespread failures that pose
significant challenges to training stability:

- **Fault Types:**
  - CUDA errors (GPU hardware/driver failures)
  - NaN values (numerical instability)
  - Task hangs (communication timeouts, deadlocks)
  - Node failures (hardware issues)

- **Failure Characteristics:**
  - **Fail-stop nature:** Traditional approaches stop training immediately
    when failures occur
  - **High diagnostic overhead:** Identifying root causes requires significant
    time and expertise
  - **Frequency scales with cluster size:** Larger clusters experience more
    frequent failures

### Key Metrics

- **ETTR (Effective Training Time Ratio):**
  The ratio of effective training time to total job runtime. This metric
  captures both fault frequency and recovery efficiency.
  - Formula: `ETTR = Effective Training Time / Total Runtime`
  - Higher ETTR indicates better training efficiency

- **MFU (Model FLOPs Utilization):**
  Measures how efficiently the model utilizes available compute resources
  compared to theoretical peak performance.
  - Reflects both hardware utilization and software optimization

- Save checkpoints frequently (e.g., every N steps or every M minutes)
- Store checkpoints on reliable persistent storage
- Use asynchronous checkpointing to minimize training interruption
- Implement checkpoint versioning and cleanup policies

### Monitoring and Alerting

- Monitor GPU utilization, temperature, and errors
- Track training metrics (loss, throughput, MFU)
- Set up alerts for anomalies and failures
- Maintain training logs for post-mortem analysis

### Resource Planning

- Provision 10-20% extra capacity for fault tolerance
- Consider spot/preemptible instances with appropriate checkpointing
- Plan for peak resource usage during checkpoint writing
- Use resource quotas to prevent resource exhaustion

### Testing

- Test failure scenarios in staging environments
