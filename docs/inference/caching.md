## What is Prefix Caching

Prefix caching in LLM inference optimizes performance by storing and reusing
previously computed key-value (KV) cache data. When multiple requests share
common prefixes (e.g., system prompts, chat history), the computation for
these shared portions can be cached and reused, significantly reducing
Time To First Token (TTFT) and improving throughput.

**Benefits:**

- Reduced computation for repeated prefixes
- Lower Time To First Token (TTFT)
- Higher overall throughput
- Better resource utilization
- Cost reduction in serving scenarios

## KV Cache Offloading and Storage Hierarchy

As LLM context windows continue to expand, KV cache storage requirements grow
exponentially. To manage this growth, modern inference systems employ a
hierarchical storage approach, offloading KV cache data across multiple
storage tiers based on access patterns and performance requirements.

![dynamo](../../diagrams/dynamo-memory.png)

### Storage Hierarchy

The KV cache storage hierarchy typically follows this pattern, ordered by
access speed and cost:

1. **VRAM (GPU Memory)**: Fastest access, highest cost, limited capacity
   - Primary storage for active KV cache during inference
   - Lowest latency for attention computation
   - Typical capacity: 16GB - 80GB per GPU

2. **RAM (Host Memory)**: Fast access, moderate cost, larger capacity
   - Intermediate storage for warm KV cache
   - Shared across multiple GPUs on the same node
   - Typical capacity: 256GB - 2TB per node

3. **SSD (Solid State Drive)**: Moderate access speed, lower cost
   - Storage for cold KV cache with high-speed access requirements
   - Persistent across system restarts
   - Typical capacity: 1TB - 16TB per node

4. **Local Disk (HDD)**: Slower access, low cost, high capacity
   - Archival storage for infrequently accessed KV cache
   - Long-term persistence
   - Typical capacity: 4TB - 100TB per node

5. **Remote Object Storage**: Network-based, lowest cost, unlimited scale
   - Distributed storage for shared KV cache across clusters
   - Enables cross-node KV cache sharing
   - Examples: S3, OSS, Ceph, MinIO

### Offloading Strategies

Effective KV cache offloading requires intelligent management:

- **Automatic tiering**: Move KV cache between tiers based on access patterns
- **Prefetching**: Load KV cache from slower tiers before needed
- **Compression**: Reduce storage requirements and transfer bandwidth
- **Deduplication**: Share identical KV cache blocks across requests
- **Eviction policies**: LRU, LFU, or application-aware eviction strategies

**Benefits:**

- Reduced computation for repeated prefixes
- Lower Time To First Token (TTFT)
- Higher overall throughput
- Better resource utilization
- Cost reduction in serving scenarios

## Shared Prefix Caching

Shared prefix caching allows multiple requests to share KV cache for common
prefixes across different sessions or users.

### NIXL

[`NIXL`](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/nixl) provides shared prefix caching
capabilities for LLM inference systems.

**Key Features:**

- Cross-request prefix sharing
- Integration with multiple inference engines
- Efficient cache management

### DCN (Distributed Compute Node)

DCN architecture enables distributed prefix caching across multiple compute
nodes. Originally from Red Hat OpenStack Platform, DCN provides:

- **Distributed compute node (DCN) architecture**: For edge use cases
  allowing remote compute and storage nodes to be deployed remotely while
  sharing a common centralized control plane
- **Strategic workload positioning**: Allows positioning workloads closer
  to operational needs for higher performance
- **Shared caching layer**: Enables prefix cache sharing across distributed
  nodes

For more details, see the [Red Hat DCN Documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openstack_platform/17.1/html/deploying_a_distributed_compute_node_dcn_architecture/understanding_dcn).

> **Note**: The DCN (Distributed Compute Node) architecture referenced here
> is primarily an OpenStack cloud infrastructure concept. While the distributed
> caching principles may apply to LLM inference scenarios, this documentation
> link refers to general edge computing deployment patterns rather than
> LLM-specific caching implementations. Further research is needed to validate
> specific DCN applications for LLM inference prefix caching.

## Distributed KV Cache Solutions

Distributed KV cache systems manage KV cache across multiple nodes, enabling
efficient sharing and offloading to remote storage. These solutions are
critical for scaling LLM inference to handle large context windows and
high-throughput serving scenarios.

### Mooncake

[`Mooncake`](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake) is a distributed KV cache
service designed to alleviate storage pressure in LLM inference systems. It
addresses the exponential growth in KV cache storage requirements as model
context windows expand.

**Key Features:**

- **Distributed KV Cache Management**: Shares KV cache across multiple nodes

- **Integration with Inference Engines**: Works with SGlang and other
  inference frameworks
- **Persistent Storage**: Enables KV cache persistence across service restarts

**Architecture:**

Mooncake implements a distributed architecture that separates cache storage
from compute nodes:

- **Cache Storage Nodes**: Dedicated nodes for storing KV cache data
- **Compute Nodes**: Inference nodes that generate and consume KV cache
- **Metadata Management**: Tracks KV cache location and access patterns
- **Transfer Optimization**: Minimizes cross-node data transfer overhead

**Performance Considerations:**

While Mooncake and similar distributed KV cache services reduce storage
pressure, cross-node data transfer remains a primary performance bottleneck.
Network latency and bandwidth limitations can impact overall system throughput,
especially for long-context scenarios.

### Next-Generation Hardware Integration

Modern distributed KV cache solutions increasingly leverage next-generation
hardware capabilities to overcome network bottlenecks:

- **Ultra-high Bandwidth (UB) Interconnects**: 400Gbps+ bandwidth for
  high-speed cross-node communication

- Memory-semantic access patterns matching KV cache usage
- Unified memory view across distributed nodes

**Industry Initiatives:**

The Chinese AI infrastructure community is actively developing solutions that
integrate next-generation hardware with distributed KV cache services. For
example, proposals exist to integrate Lingqiao SuperNode shared memory
capabilities into Mooncake, leveraging next-generation hardware features to
provide universal acceleration for inference services.

### Other Distributed KV Cache Solutions

Several other projects provide distributed KV cache capabilities:

For architecture details, see the
[KVBM README](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/lib/bindings/kvbm/README.md).

### KV Cache Runner (KVCR)

[`KV Cache Runner (KVCR)`](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/kvcr) treats KV cache as
a distributed resource spanning memory and storage tiers. A KV-aware router
maintains the global cache inventory and sends source hints, while each KVCR
instance manages local residency, policy, and data movement.

**Key Features:**

- Pluggable admission, eviction, placement, and staging policies
- Cross-tier and peer-to-peer movement through NIXL
- Optional `KVCR-Guard` for preserving KVCR-owned host memory across engine
  failures
- Framework- and router-agnostic integration model

KVCR is under active development and is not yet recommended for production
use. Treat it as an emerging design alongside Dynamo KVBM, not as a proven
drop-in replacement.

### Host Memory Caching

Host memory caching utilizes system RAM for storing KV cache data,
providing:

- Lower cost compared to GPU memory
- Larger cache capacity
- Cross-GPU sharing capabilities
- Persistence across model reloads
