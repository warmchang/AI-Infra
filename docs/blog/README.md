## 2026-09-10: 从 DRA 到集群升级：AI Infra 交流中的七个工程问题

- [从 DRA 到集群升级：AI Infra 交流中的七个工程问题 (Chinese)](./2026-09-10/2026-09-10-workshop-kubecon-ai-infra-takeaways_zh.md)

A sanitized, team-oriented synthesis of Workshop and KubeCon discussions:

- Separates durable engineering takeaways from unverified roadmap or vendor
  statements
- Frames DRA adoption around version compatibility, Device Plugin migration,
  and the scheduler/Kubelet/driver responsibility boundary
- Maps two-level scheduling across queue admission, workload-level placement,
  DRA allocation, and node-local device preparation
- Turns GPU sandbox and cold-start observations into measurable benchmark
  stages
- Connects immutable-node upgrades, strict maintenance windows, List/Watch
  bursts, etcd pressure, DRANET, and CEL guardrails to concrete follow-up work

## 2026-06-15: KEP-766 DisaggregatedSet 深入解读：为何对 AI 工作负载重要

- [KEP-766 DisaggregatedSet 深入解读：为何对 AI 工作负载重要 (Chinese)](./2026-06-15/2026-06-15-kep-766-disaggregatedset-ai-workloads_zh.md)

A Chinese architecture-focused analysis of `KEP-766 DisaggregatedSet`, updated
with the post-issue upstream reality that LWS `v0.9.0` already includes the
proposal, implementation, controller, and Helm integration work:

- **Problem definition**: explains why manually coordinating multiple
  `LeaderWorkerSet` resources becomes fragile for prefill/decode and other
  multi-role inference services.
- **API and rollout model**: breaks down `spec.roles`,
  `LeaderWorkerSetTemplateSpec`, role/revision labels, and the N-dimensional
  rolling update algorithm.
- **AI workload impact**: connects coordinated revision management,
  per-revision headless Services, and role-level resource differences back to
  production inference operations.
- **Scope boundaries**: separates `DisaggregatedSet` from higher-level
  platforms such as `KServe + llm-d`, `AIBrix`, `Kthena`, `Dynamo/Grove`, and
  broader role APIs such as `RBG`.

## 2026-05-21: Kubernetes Scheduler 演进主线：从 Predicates/Priorities 到 Scheduling Framework，再到 Workload-Aware Scheduling

- [Kubernetes Scheduler 演进主线：从 Predicates/Priorities 到 Scheduling Framework，再到 Workload-Aware Scheduling (Chinese)](./2026-05-21/2026-05-21-kubernetes-scheduler-framework-evolution_zh.md)

A Chinese architecture-focused retrospective on how `kube-scheduler` evolved
from built-in predicates/priorities into a plugin framework and then toward
workload-level scheduling:

- **Three-stage arc**: frames scheduler history as `Predicates/Priorities +
  Extenders` -> `Scheduling Framework` -> `Workload-Aware Scheduling`.
- **Framework-centered narrative**: uses `KEP-624` and the classic extension
  points diagram as the core explanatory device, instead of turning the piece
  into release-note enumeration.
- **Why `v1.16-v1.20` matters**: explains why that period works as a practical
  "framework formation phase" for writing, while still distinguishing that from
  the official `v1.19` stable milestone.
- **Why this still matters**: connects `profiles`, queue behavior, and
  `v1.35/v1.36` workload-aware scheduling back to the original framework
  design.

## 2026-05-18: Cache Offload 深入：Run:ai Model Streamer、Dynamo ModelExpress 与大模型加载加速

- [Cache Offload 深入：Run:ai Model Streamer、Dynamo ModelExpress 与大模型加载加速 (Chinese)](./2026-05-18/2026-05-18-model-streamer-modelexpress-model-loading-zh.md)

A Chinese production-oriented analysis of the model-weight loading path behind
LLM cold starts:

- **Separates weights from KV cache**: clarifies why model loading and runtime
  KV-cache offload have different lifecycle and failure semantics.
- **Three-path comparison**: compares prefetch/hierarchical caching, Run:ai
  Model Streamer, and Dynamo ModelExpress by data path and operating boundary.
- **First replica plus fleet scale-out**: positions Model Streamer for
  object-storage-to-GPU loading and ModelExpress for NIXL/RDMA reuse from an
  existing worker.
- **vLLM and Dynamo examples**: includes current `runai_streamer`, sharded
  loading, and unified `mx` configuration paths.
- **Production guardrails**: covers readiness, identity, immutable model
  versions, compatibility, fallback paths, and cold/warm/scale-out benchmarks.

## 2026-05-13: 推理编排方案如何选择？AIBrix、Kthena、Dynamo、llm-d、KServe、vLLM Production Stack 与 SGLang/RBG

- [推理编排方案如何选择？AIBrix、Kthena、Dynamo、llm-d、KServe、vLLM Production Stack 与 SGLang/RBG (Chinese)](./2026-05-13/2026-05-13-how-to-choose-inference-orchestration-stacks_zh.md)
- [How to choose an inference orchestration stack: AIBrix, Kthena, Dynamo, llm-d, KServe, vLLM Production Stack, and SGLang/RBG](./2026-05-13/2026-05-13-how-to-choose-inference-orchestration-stacks.md)

A bilingual update of the earlier inference orchestration theme, reframed
around stack layers rather than project names:

- **Do not compare unlike layers**: separates runtime, serving stack, control
  plane, and workload primitive before comparing projects.
- **Latest public progress**: updates `KServe + llm-d`, `AIBrix`, `Kthena`,
  `Dynamo/Grove`, `vLLM Production Stack`, and `SGLang/RBG` to reflect their
  current public positioning as of 2026-05-13.
- **Infrastructure-first decision guide**: gives a practical selection path for
  Volcano, KServe, vLLM, NVIDIA, vanilla Kubernetes, and SGLang users.
- **PD is still conditional**: keeps the warning that prefill/decode
  disaggregation is a systems tradeoff, not an automatic win.

## 2026-05-11: NVIDIA 推理编排主线拆解：Dynamo、Grove、KAI Scheduler 与 GPU DRA Driver

- [NVIDIA 推理编排主线拆解：Dynamo、Grove、KAI Scheduler 与 GPU DRA Driver (Chinese)](./2026-05-11/2026-05-11-dynamo-grove-kai-dra-ecosystem-zh.md)

A Chinese ecosystem analysis that zooms in from the broader NVIDIA open source
landscape to the orchestration path around Dynamo:

- **Not four competing projects**: frames `Dynamo -> Grove -> KAI Scheduler -> GPU DRA Driver`
  as one vertical architecture from serving intent to hardware topology.
- **Why Grove matters**: explains Grove as the workload abstraction layer for
  multi-role disaggregated inference, not just another controller.
- **Why KAI matters**: highlights topology-aware scheduling, hierarchical
  PodGroups, DRA support, and fairshare as the execution layer for AI clusters.
- **Why DRA matters now**: connects upstream DRA progress in Kubernetes 1.35/1.36
  to NVIDIA's `ComputeDomain` and future GPU-sharing semantics.
- **Where NIXL, NCCL, and AICR fit**: positions `NIXL/NCCL` as the data movement
  and GPU communication layer, and `AICR/GPU Operator` as cluster baseline and
  operations support rather than the orchestration core itself.
- **Where LWS and vLLM fit**: positions `LWS + Volcano` as the official
  community-native path, and notes `Koordinator` can play a similar scheduling
  role when teams already standardize on it; `vLLM` remains engine/data-plane
  rather than the same layer as Grove/KAI/DRA.

## 2026-05-04: 大规模 GPU 调度：拓扑、队列、公平性的系统化实践

- [大规模 GPU 调度：拓扑、队列、公平性的系统化实践 (Chinese)](./2026-05-04/2026-05-04-large-scale-gpu-scheduling-topology-queue-fairness_zh.md)

A Chinese platform-oriented draft that connects topology-aware GPU placement
with queue admission, quota, fair sharing, preemption, DRA, HAMi, and
fault-aware scheduling:

- **Workload-first framing**: explains why large-scale GPU scheduling should
  start from workload admission and queue fairness rather than single-Pod
  placement.
- **Single-cluster baseline**: recommends `Kueue + kube-scheduler + DRA/HAMi`
  before introducing a replacement scheduler or deeper scheduler customization.
- **Project role split**: compares Kueue, DRA, HAMi, Volcano, KAI Scheduler,
  and Koordinator by scheduling responsibility and operating boundary.
- **Decision matrix**: gives platform signals for when to stay simple and when
  topology, fairshare, gang, preemption, or colocation pressure justifies a
  more complex scheduling path.

## 2026-04-28: 如何理解 Hugging Face、私有 Hugging Face、MatrixHub、Harbor + Dragonfly + ModelPack 与 ModelExpress

- [如何理解 Hugging Face、私有 Hugging Face、MatrixHub、Harbor + Dragonfly + ModelPack 与 ModelExpress (Chinese)](./2026-04-28/2026-04-28-understanding-model-distribution-stack_zh.md)

A Chinese architecture-oriented article that places public model hubs, private
model hubs, OCI-first artifact stacks, node-level P2P distribution, and
runtime weight transfer into a single model distribution view:

- **Layered framing**: separates public model sources, enterprise governance,
  node distribution, and runtime acceleration.
- **Scenario-driven comparison**: explains when to prefer MatrixHub, when to
  prefer Harbor + ModelPack + Dragonfly, and when ModelExpress becomes the
  right answer.
- **One-stack diagram**: provides a Mermaid overview covering Hugging Face,
  ModelScope, MatrixHub, Harbor, Dragonfly, ModelPack, and ModelExpress.

## 2026-04-23: Kubernetes v1.36 DRA 整体设计

- [Kubernetes v1.36 DRA 的整体设计：从请求入口到调度、状态与拓扑 (Chinese)](./2026-04-23/2026-04-23-kubernetes-v1.36-dra-ai-infra_zh.md)

A Chinese architecture analysis based on the Kubernetes v1.36 DRA KEP map:

- **Architecture map**: organizes DRA by request entry points, resource
  modeling, scheduling and binding, status, observability, and admin
  boundaries.
- **Official DRA blog follow-up**: now also folds in the upstream 2026-05-07
  DRA blog and links the recent v1.33 -> v1.34 -> v1.36 progression into the
  same article.
- **Topology focus**: highlights why GPU/NIC, NUMA, PCIe, fabric, and
  supernode placement reshape the scheduler problem.
- **Maturity and next steps**: adds a v1.37 follow-up watchlist plus KEP and
  open-issue limitation tables, separating practical v1.36 capabilities from
  DRA+WAS and other still-open design directions.

## 2026-04-15: Kubernetes v1.34 PSI Metrics Beta（AI-Infra 落地）

- [Kubernetes v1.34 PSI Metrics Beta：AI-Infra 该如何落地 (Chinese)](./2026-04-15/2026-04-15-kubernetes-v1.34-psi-metrics-beta-ai-infra_zh.md)

A Chinese practical guide focused on operationalizing PSI metrics in AI
clusters after KEP-4205 moved to Beta:

- **From kernel to platform signal**: maps Linux PSI into kubelet Summary API
  and `/metrics/cadvisor` collection paths.
- **Actionable observability**: highlights the six PSI Prometheus metrics and
  proposes node/workload alert starting points.
- **AI-oriented closed loop**: links PSI pressure to scheduling and scaling
  decisions instead of keeping it dashboard-only.

## 2026-04-15: VolumeGroupSnapshot + CBT for AI Checkpoints

- [用 VolumeGroupSnapshot + CBT 改善 AI Checkpoint 备份与恢复 (Chinese)](./2026-04-15/2026-04-15-volume-group-snapshot-and-cbt-for-ai-checkpoints_zh.md)

A Chinese implementation note that combines KEP-3476 and KEP-3314 for AI
training backup and recovery:

- **Consistent multi-volume recovery point**: uses VolumeGroupSnapshot for
  crash-consistent checkpoints across PVC groups.
- **Incremental backup path**: introduces changed-block tracking (CBT) to avoid
  repeated full-volume transfers.
- **Production rollout framing**: includes driver capability checks, phased
  adoption, and restore-first validation guidance.

## 2026-04-13: AI 训练作业管理：JobSet、Kueue、Ray 与 Gang Scheduling

- [AI 训练作业管理：JobSet、Kueue、Ray 与 Gang Scheduling (Chinese)](./2026-04-13/2026-04-13-ai-training-job-management-jobset-kueue-ray-gang_zh.md)

A Chinese architecture note that separates training job orchestration into
workload topology, queue admission, runtime execution, and gang scheduling:

- **Boundary-first comparison**: explains why `JobSet`, `Kueue`, `KubeRay`, and
  `Gang Scheduling` are complementary layers rather than direct alternatives.
- **Reference architecture**: shows how a multi-team platform can submit
  `JobSet`, `RayJob`, or other training CRDs through Kueue before Pod creation.
- **Practical guidance**: recommends `JobSet + Kueue` for static distributed
  training and `KubeRay + Kueue` for Ray Train/Tune/RL workloads.
- **Fact check**: records current release versions and KEP-4671 stage/milestone
  information as of 2026-07-11.

## 2026-04-06: GPU Pod 冷启动优化：AI 工作负载的性能突破

- [GPU Pod 冷启动优化：AI 工作负载的性能突破 (Chinese)](./2026-04-06/2026-04-06-gpu-pod-cold-start-optimization_zh.md)

A Chinese practical deep dive that extends the AI startup critical-path model
from PR #281 into production scenarios:

- **Critical-path + economics**: combines startup decomposition with tenant-level
  warm-pool cost modeling.
- **Model loading first**: prioritizes Run:ai Model Streamer and cache
  orchestration (Fluid) before micro-level scheduler tuning.
- **Capacity-aware scaling**: links large-cluster scheduling patterns with
  cold-start budget control under multi-tenant AI workloads.
- **Not only acceleration**: introduces workaround paths (VPA and in-place Pod
  container restarts in v1.35) to reduce unnecessary full cold starts.

## 2026-04-01: Kubernetes Swap Status in 2026

- [Kubernetes Swap Status in 2026: kubelet behavior, memory pressure, and what is next](./2026-04-01/2026-04-01-kubernetes-swap-status-kubelet-and-memory-pressure.md)
- [Kubernetes Swap 现状（2026）：kubelet 行为、内存压力与场景化落地 (Chinese)](./2026-04-01/2026-04-01-kubernetes-swap-status-kubelet-memory-pressure_zh.md)

An up-to-date status summary of Kubernetes swap support with a practical
operations lens:

- **Current status**: KEP-2400 is implemented and closed; NodeSwap is GA in 1.34
- **kubelet behavior today**: `NoSwap` vs `LimitedSwap`, Linux + cgroup v2 path
- **Operational focus**: observability endpoints, `kubectl top --show-swap`,
  and memory-pressure tuning boundaries
- **Roadmap gap**: workload-controlled swap, swap-aware scheduling, and
  swap-aware evictions tracked in #5359/#5424/#5433
- **Scenario-oriented guidance**: converts conference materials into concrete
  rollout scenarios (cost density, memory spikes, control-plane protection,
  and fine-grained policy exploration)

## 2026-03-24: Maintenance Scan (Outdated Resources + Safe Upgrades)

Implemented in this cleanup:

- Standardized blog filenames to `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-name(_lang).md` to reduce
  ambiguity in cross-references and search indexing.
- Removed duplicate long-form blog listings from top-level READMEs and kept the
  full archive in this file as the canonical index.
- Removed Agones posts and all corresponding index references.

Safe upgrade proposals for follow-up:

- Add a lightweight markdown link checker in CI for `docs/blog/**`.
- Run a quarterly metadata refresh (`last_updated`, canonical links, and stale
  external references).

## 2026-03-24: vLLM v0.18.0 发布解读：AI-Infra 视角的重点变化

- [vLLM v0.18.0 发布解读：AI-Infra 团队值得重点关注什么？ (Chinese)](./2026-03-24/2026-03-24-vllm-v0.18.0-ai-infra-highlights_zh.md)

A Chinese analysis of vLLM v0.18.0 release notes from an AI infrastructure
operations perspective:

- **Serving interface expansion**: New `--grpc` serving mode and
  `vllm launch render` for GPU-less preprocessing
- **Memory hierarchy upgrades**: Smarter KV offloading, FlexKV backend, and
  multi-KV-group offloading support
- **Large-scale MoE serving**: Elastic EP Milestone 2 with NIXL-EP and faster
  expert loading path
- **Operational risk gating**: Known Qwen3.5 + FP8 KV cache accuracy issue on
  B200, plus dependency/default behavior changes
- **Rollout checklist**: Concrete canary and upgrade checks for platform teams

## 2026-03-13: NVIDIA AICR：把 GPU 集群安装经验固化成可复现 Recipe

- [NVIDIA AICR 中文介绍](./2026-03-13/2026-03-13-nvidia-aicr-introduction_zh.md)

A Chinese introduction to NVIDIA AI Cluster Runtime (AICR), based on the
project's official repository and the recently merged AI-Infra PR:

- **What AICR is**: A recipe-driven tool for optimized, validated, and
  reproducible GPU-accelerated Kubernetes cluster setups
- **Why it matters**: Turns fragile platform runbooks into version-locked,
  auditable deployment artifacts for Helm and GitOps workflows
- **Core workflow**: `snapshot` captures live state, `recipe` defines the
  target, `validate` checks drift, and `bundle` renders deployable outputs
- **How to position it**: AICR sits above GPU Operator and complements DRA,
  focusing on cluster baseline management rather than device allocation
- **Current scope**: Early-stage but promising support for EKS, GKE, Kind,
  H100/GB200, Ubuntu, Kubeflow, and Dynamo

## 2026-03-13: 【2020】拜耳作物科学以 15,000 节点的 GKE 集群为未来播种

- [Bayer Crop Science and a 15K-Node GKE Cluster (Chinese)](./2026-03-13/2026-03-13-bayer-gke-15000-nodes_zh.md)

A Chinese translation and retrospective on Google Cloud's November 17, 2020
case study about Bayer Crop Science scaling GKE to 15,000 worker nodes:

- **Why 1K nodes was not enough**: Route-based networking and VPC route scale
  became the practical ceiling for older cluster designs
- **Key product change**: VPC-native GKE with Alias IP removed per-node route
  dependence and unlocked larger clusters
- **Regional cluster improvement**: Custom subnet mode enabled more precise
  per-zone IP planning for large regional deployments
- **Outcome**: Single-cluster scale up to **15,000 worker nodes** and
  **50,000 Pods**
- **Still relevant in 2026**: A useful reminder that network and IP planning
  often become the first true scale bottleneck

## 2026-02-25: 贡献开源的 ROI：LF Research 2025 年调查报告解读

A Chinese blog post analyzing the Linux Foundation Research 2025 Open Source ROI
Survey, covering the business case for upstream open source contribution:

- **Hidden cost of private forks**: Organizations spending hundreds of thousands
  maintaining forks pay ongoing merge costs, delayed security patches, and
  duplicated engineering effort
- **Three core benefits of upstream contribution**: Faster security response,
  accelerated development velocity, stronger talent attraction and retention
- **Quantified ROI**: Average cost-benefit ratio of 2-5x; contributing
  organizations achieve an estimated **6x ROI** per the quantitative model
- **AI infrastructure context**: How the findings apply to Kubernetes, vLLM,
  DRA/NRI, and other fast-moving open source ecosystems
- **Practical recommendations**: Upstream-first strategy, dedicated contribution
  time, performance incentives for open source engagement
