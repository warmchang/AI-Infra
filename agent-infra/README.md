# AI Agent Platforms and Frameworks

This document provides a comprehensive overview of AI Agent platforms,
frameworks, and infrastructure projects in the cloud-native ecosystem. AI
Agents are autonomous software systems that can perceive their environment,
make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals, often using Large
Language Models (LLMs) as their core reasoning engine.

## Overview

AI Agents represent the next evolution in AI infrastructure, moving beyond
simple model inference to autonomous systems that can:

- Execute complex multi-step workflows
- Use tools and APIs to interact with external systems
- Maintain memory and context across conversations
- Make decisions based on goals and constraints
- Learn and adapt from feedback

### Four-Stage Evolution of AI Agents

According to **Professor Yang Qiang** (Hong Kong University of Science and
Technology), AI Agents (智能体) are expected to evolve through four distinct
stages in 2026 and beyond:

1. **Stage 1: Human-Defined Goals and Planning**
   - Both objectives and execution plans are defined by humans
   - Agents follow predetermined workflows
   - Current most common implementation stage

2. **Stage 2: AI-Assisted Planning**
   - Goals are defined by humans
   - Planning and execution strategies are assisted by AI
   - AI helps optimize workflows but humans maintain control

3. **Stage 3: AI-Learned Planning from Process Data**
   - AI observes human workflows and process data
   - Automatically learns and generates planning strategies
   - Reduces human intervention in routine tasks

4. **Stage 4: Fully Autonomous Agents**
   - Ultimate stage: Both goals and planning are defined internally by LLMs
   - Agents operate with true autonomy
   - Self-directed decision-making and execution

**Current State**: Most AI Agents today operate at Stages 1 and 2.

**Economic Value Insight**: According to industry observations, the bottleneck
for agents creating real economic value is not in the model capabilities
themselves, but in:

- **Environment**: Deploying models into diverse enterprise environments
- **Education**: Training organizations to effectively use agent systems

Even without further model improvements, significant economic benefits can be
realized by deploying existing models across various enterprise scenarios. The
focus should be on integration, deployment infrastructure, and organizational
readiness.

## Production Agent Infra: 9 Layers + 4 Cross-Cutting Capabilities

For a production-oriented architecture view, see
[AI Infra 全景图：Agent Framework、调度、编排、沙箱、记忆管理、Tracing 分层拆解](./ai-agent-infra-9-layers-zh.md).

This companion document maps the runtime path from **L0 基础资源层** to
**L8 可观测与运营层**, and explains how **security governance**,
**CI/CD and release governance**, **FinOps**, and **developer experience**
cut across every layer. It is a useful complement to this index-style
ecosystem guide because it focuses on how production Agent systems are
assembled, debugged, evaluated, governed, and operated end to end.

### Kubernetes SIG Agent Sandbox

<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox">`agent-sandbox`</a>

Official Kubernetes SIG project providing secure sandbox environments for
running AI agents with strong isolation guarantees.

**Key Features:**

- Secure execution environments for agent code
- Strong isolation between agents and host systems
- Integration with Kubernetes security policies
- Support for code interpreters and tool execution

**Status**: Kubernetes SIG project (official)

See also: [Agent Sandbox Documentation](../docs/kubernetes/isolation.md#6-agent-sandbox-kubernetes-sig-project)

### K8E

<a href="https://github.com/xiaods/k8e">`xiaods/k8e`</a>

K8E is a self-hosted agent sandbox distribution that packages a lightweight
Kubernetes cluster, a sandbox gateway, warm-pool management, and runtime
integration into a single binary. It spans several layers that are normally
assembled separately: the cluster distribution, agent-facing sandbox
operations, Kubernetes lifecycle management, network policy, and pluggable
isolation runtimes.

**Key Features:**

- Single-binary installation for a Kubernetes-based sandbox cluster
- Warm pools for low-latency session allocation
- gVisor, Kata Containers, and Firecracker runtime integration
- Per-session Cilium eBPF egress policy and resource governance
- CLI and E2B-compatible API surfaces for session, command, file, terminal,
  and snapshot operations
- Compatibility with `kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox`

**Status**: Active Apache-2.0 project. The integrated agent-sandbox surface is
evolving quickly; validate its security model, runtime compatibility, upgrade
path, and performance against your own production requirements.

**Use Cases:**

- Teams that want a self-contained Kubernetes sandbox appliance instead of
  assembling the cluster, gateway, warm pool, networking, and runtimes
  independently
- Private agent execution clusters with multiple isolation profiles
- Coding-agent or tool-execution services that need ephemeral workspaces,
  audited operations, and fast session claims

K8E should not be compared one-for-one with a single CRD controller or a
single isolation runtime. It is an integrated distribution that composes both
layers and can consume `kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox` APIs.

### Agent Substrate

<a href="https://github.com/agent-substrate/substrate">`agent-substrate/substrate`</a>

Agent Substrate is a Kubernetes-based runtime and control plane for
agent-like workloads. Instead of keeping one Pod bound to one long-lived
session, it maps a larger set of stateful "actors" onto a smaller pool of
ready workers and keeps the Kubernetes control plane out of the hot path.

**Key Features:**

- Actor/worker multiplexing for higher density
- Suspend/resume lifecycle for stateful sessions
- Real-time assignment and traffic routing to active workers
- gVisor-based OCI container execution with framework-agnostic compatibility

**Status**: Very early development; not production-ready yet

**Use Cases:**

- Large fleets of mostly-idle coding or tool-using agents
- Stateful agent sessions that need sub-second reactivation
- Platforms that want Kubernetes primitives underneath but lower latency than
  Pod-per-session orchestration

### Agent Infra Ecosystem Snapshot (2026)

Based on the "Agent Infra 生态图谱" conference summary (KCD Beijing / vLLM
community), the current sandbox/runtime ecosystem can be summarized as:

- **K8s standard layer — `kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox`**: SIG Apps official
  project with `Sandbox` CRD, `SandboxWarmPool`, and deep GKE integration.
- **Agent runtime substrate — `agent-substrate/substrate`**: Core runtime
  system for invocation-based agent wake-up, suspend/resume, and shared
  worker pools on Kubernetes.
- **Alibaba `OpenSandbox`**: Four sandbox types (`Coding`, `GUI`, `Exec`,
  `RL`) plus a three-tier isolation design for heterogeneous agent workloads.
- **OpenKruise AIO Sandbox**: Lifecycle management, E2B protocol compatibility,
  and an all-in-one container design to simplify framework integration.
- **ByteDance `DeerFlow 2.0`**: Sub-agent orchestration with independent
  sandbox mode for fine-grained isolation and parallel scheduling.
- **Tencent Cloud Agent Runtime**: Optimized for production throughput with
  ~100 ms cold start and 100K-level concurrency claims.

These projects indicate a convergence path: **standardized CRD control plane +
durable actor/session runtime + pluggable sandbox runtime backends + warm pool
or snapshot-based latency control**.

#### Kubernetes Dynamic Containers Watch (2026-06-18)

[kubernetes/enhancements#6169](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/6169)
adds the first KEP draft for
[KEP-5972: Dynamic Containers](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/5972).
As of this snapshot, the PR is still open, labeled `do-not-merge/hold`, and
under active API / SIG-Auth review, so it should be tracked as an upstream
design signal rather than a consumable Kubernetes API.

The important AI infra signal is that Kubernetes core is discussing whether a
running Pod can become a mutable execution envelope for agentic and
high-churn workloads:

- **Warm pools for agents**: pre-create Pods that have already paid scheduling,
  sandbox, CNI, volume, and device setup cost, then add short-lived main
  containers later for low-latency tool execution.
- **Hierarchical scheduling**: let Kubernetes allocate the coarse Pod resource
  budget while Ray, Slurm, or agent runtimes perform fine-grained local
  container placement inside that envelope.
- **Restore / migration fast path**: schedule a shell Pod first, then restore
  or migrate workload state into it.
- **In-place sidecar or daemon changes**: swap supporting containers with less
  disruption than full Pod replacement.

The latest design update moved new Pod mutability behind a dedicated
`pods/dynamic` subresource instead of broadening default Pod update rules. That
subresource is not intended to be granted by the default `edit` ClusterRole.
The draft also adds a read-only `pods/allocated` view for the kubelet-allocated
Pod spec and gates the feature through `DynamicContainers` on
`kube-apiserver` and `kubelet`.

The active review concern is admission and policy compatibility. After the
SIG-Auth discussion, the proposed direction is:

- provide a static cluster-level opt-out, likely as an API server flag;
- treat the new subresource as the future extension point for broader Pod
  mutability, while still limiting the first alpha scope;
- require admission webhooks and policies that cover Pod create or update to
  also cover `pods/dynamic`; otherwise requests through the new subresource
  should be rejected instead of bypassing legacy policy.

For this repository, the practical takeaway is to keep agent sandbox
architecture decoupled from this KEP for now: design warm pools and sandbox
APIs around existing CRDs/runtime backends, but watch `pods/dynamic` because it
could eventually collapse some custom fast-start paths back into core
Kubernetes.

#### Agent Sandbox Selection Update (2026-08-25)

Recent agent sandbox projects should be compared by layer, not as direct
one-for-one replacements. A practical platform usually combines an
agent-facing API, a Kubernetes lifecycle controller, and one or more isolation
runtimes:

| Layer | Candidate Projects | Primary Role | Selection Notes |
| ----- | ------------------ | ------------ | --------------- |
| Agent-facing sandbox platform | [OpenSandbox](https://github.com/alibaba/OpenSandbox), [CubeSandbox](https://github.com/TencentCloud/CubeSandbox), [E2B](https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b), [Daytona](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona), [Sandbox0](https://github.com/sandbox0-ai/sandbox0) | SDK/API, sandbox lifecycle, command/file/browser execution, templates | Use OpenSandbox as the broad self-hosted default; evaluate CubeSandbox for high-density E2B-compatible microVM pools; check Daytona's AGPLv3 impact before embedding. |
| Kubernetes lifecycle API | [kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox), [agent-sandbox/agent-sandbox](https://github.com/agent-sandbox/agent-sandbox), [volcano-sh/agentcube](https://github.com/volcano-sh/agentcube) | CRD/controller, warm pools, stable sandbox identity, scheduling hooks | `kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox` is the neutral K8s API layer; `agent-sandbox/agent-sandbox` adds REST/MCP and E2B compatibility; AgentCube is still proposal/early design. |
| Integrated Kubernetes sandbox distribution | [K8E](https://github.com/xiaods/k8e) | Single-binary cluster, sandbox gateway, warm pools, network policy, and runtime integration | Evaluate when a self-contained sandbox appliance is preferable to assembling each layer. Treat its sub-500ms warm-pool claim and other performance figures as project-reported until reproduced in your environment. |
| Agent runtime substrate | [agent-substrate/substrate](https://github.com/agent-substrate/substrate) | Invocation routing, worker pools, agent actor lifecycle, suspend/resume | Use when agent fleets are mostly idle and dedicated pods would waste resources; pair it with Agent Sandbox or runtime sandboxing for the isolation boundary. |
| Isolation runtime | [gVisor](https://github.com/google/gvisor), [Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers), [containerd/nerdbox](https://github.com/containerd/nerdbox), [Firecracker](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker), [Kuasar](https://github.com/kuasar-io/kuasar) | Runtime boundary for untrusted code | Start with gVisor for density and operational simplicity; use Kata for VM-level tenant boundaries and GPU paths; treat Firecracker as a low-level primitive unless the team owns the control plane. |
| Local coding-agent sandbox | [Cleanroom](https://github.com/buildkite/cleanroom), [Brood Box](https://github.com/stacklok/brood-box), [microsandbox](https://github.com/superradcompany/microsandbox), [BoxLite](https://github.com/boxlite-ai/boxlite), [Matchlock](https://github.com/jingkaihe/matchlock), [Shuru](https://github.com/superhq-ai/shuru), [sandbox-runtime](https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime) | Developer-machine isolation, repo policy, credential proxy, diff review | Prefer Cleanroom/Brood Box when the threat model is coding-agent access to a repo; use microsandbox/BoxLite for embeddable local microVM APIs; use sandbox-runtime for OS policy guardrails without VM isolation. |
| Watch / avoid for now | [BinSquare/ERA](https://github.com/BinSquare/ERA), [autohandai/sandbox-core](https://github.com/autohandai/sandbox-core), [SmolVM](https://github.com/CelestoAI/SmolVM), [Gondolin](https://github.com/earendil-works/gondolin), [Pyro](https://github.com/danievanzyl/pyro), `opencapsule/opencapsule` | Early-stage or unclear availability | ERA is archived/deprecated; `opencapsule/opencapsule` was not publicly resolvable on GitHub when checked; the remaining projects are useful to track or borrow ideas from but need deeper maturity validation. |

`agent-substrate/substrate` is closest to a **durable agent-session runtime**
layer rather than a generic agent framework or sandbox SDK.

- Closest architectural neighbor: `agent-sandbox/agent-sandbox` if you want a
  Kubernetes-native runtime with persistent sessions, but its center of gravity
  is REST/MCP sandbox lifecycle management and E2B compatibility.
- Closest agent-facing API alternatives: `Sandbox0` and `E2B` if you want
  session/sandbox APIs, persistent volumes, warm pools, and credential or
  network controls exposed directly to application code.
- Higher-level alternative: `kagent` if you want to define and operate agents
  as Kubernetes resources, rather than optimize actor multiplexing and
  suspend/resume latency in the runtime layer.

Default stack recommendation:

1. **Agent API**: OpenSandbox as the broad self-hosted API/SDK surface.
2. **Kubernetes lifecycle**: `kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox` for `Sandbox`,
   `SandboxTemplate`, `SandboxClaim`, and `SandboxWarmPool`.
3. **Runtime substrate**: `agent-substrate/substrate` when idle-agent density,
   invocation-based wake-up, and suspend/resume matter.
4. **Default runtime**: gVisor for CPU-only untrusted code with high density.
5. **High-risk runtime**: Kata or CubeSandbox for stronger microVM boundaries.
6. **Local development**: Cleanroom or Brood Box for repo-scoped egress,
   host-side credentials, and post-run change review.

Integrated alternative: evaluate K8E when the operational goal is a dedicated,
self-hosted sandbox cluster with the gateway, warm pool, Cilium policy, and
runtime wiring supplied together. Keep the same workload-level threat-model
review; packaging the layers together does not by itself prove the isolation
boundary or production SLOs.

## Agent Sandbox Infrastructure

Agent sandboxes provide secure, isolated execution environments for AI agents
that run untrusted code — LLM-generated Python, shell commands, file
operations, and browser automation. Designing a scalable sandbox requires
choosing the right architecture pattern and underlying technology.

### Two Architecture Patterns

<a href="https://browser-use.com/posts/two-ways-to-sandbox-agents">Browser
Use</a> describes two fundamental patterns for keeping agent code isolated
from infrastructure secrets:

**Pattern 1: Isolate the Tool** — The agent loop runs on your backend;
only dangerous operations (code execution, terminal) run in a separate
sandbox reached via HTTP. Simple to adopt but the agent still shares resources
with the API backend.

**Pattern 2: Isolate the Agent** — The entire agent runs in a sandbox
with zero secrets. A stateless **control plane** holds all credentials and
proxies every sensitive operation:

- **LLM calls**: Control plane owns the full conversation history and proxies
  to the LLM provider; sandbox only sends new messages
- **File sync**: Sandbox requests presigned upload/download URLs; never
  holds cloud credentials
- **Billing and cost caps**: Enforced at the control plane boundary

Pattern 2 makes the agent fully disposable and scales each layer
independently. Key insight: *"Your agent should have nothing worth stealing
and nothing worth preserving."*

### OpenClaw-Centric Cloud-Native Deployment

[OpenClaw](https://openclawai.github.io/) is an open-source agent framework
that already includes sandbox abstractions and backend plugins. In practice,
it maps well to Kubernetes-style control-plane/data-plane separation:

- **Agent control plane** (API, session state, policy, auth) runs as regular
  Deployments/Services in Kubernetes.
- **Execution sandbox plane** (tool calls, shell/code execution, browser/file
  access) runs in isolated workers selected by a sandbox backend.

OpenClaw's current sandbox backend options include
`DockerSandboxBackend`, `SSHSandboxBackend`, and `OpenShellSandboxBackend`,
with `mirror` and `remote` execution modes in its backend configuration.
This model is compatible with `agent-sandbox` CRDs or any internal sandbox
operator that allocates one isolated runtime per agent session.

#### Minimal Cloud-Native Shape

1. **Ingress/API Layer**: Agent gateway (`Deployment` + `Service` +
   `HorizontalPodAutoscaler`)
2. **Scheduler/Queue Layer**: Route tasks to a sandbox pool (Kubernetes Queue,
   internal queue, or workflow engine)
3. **Sandbox Runtime Layer**: One sandbox per session/task with strict quotas,
   network policy, and filesystem boundaries
4. **Observability Layer**: Trace `agent_step`, `tool_call`, and `sandbox_id`
   together for debugging and cost attribution

### Pod or VM for Agent Runtime?

Short answer: run the **control plane in Pods**, and choose Pod-runtime vs
VM-runtime for **sandbox workers** by risk level.

| Runtime choice | Best fit | Isolation strength | Startup/cost profile | GPU path |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | -------- |
| Pod (`runc`) | Trusted internal tools, low risk | Low | Fastest, cheapest | Native |
| Pod + `gVisor` RuntimeClass | Untrusted code with moderate compatibility needs | Medium | Fast, low overhead | Limited/depends on stack |
| Pod + Kata RuntimeClass (microVM isolation) | Multi-tenant untrusted workloads | High | Slower, higher overhead | Good with passthrough setups |
| Dedicated VM per agent/tenant | Strongest boundary, compliance-heavy scenarios | Very high | Slowest, most expensive | Full VM control |

#### Practical Recommendation

1. Start with **Kubernetes Pods for control plane** and **sandbox workers on
   RuntimeClass** (`gVisor` for CPU-heavy untrusted tasks, `Kata` for stricter
   isolation).
2. Use **VM pools** only for high-risk tenants, regulated data, or when kernel
   isolation/compliance requires hard VM boundaries.
3. Keep the agent runtime **ephemeral** (warm pool + TTL cleanup) and persist
   only explicit artifacts (logs, outputs, checkpoints).

Example `Sandbox` runtime selection:

```yaml
apiVersion: agents.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Sandbox
metadata:
  name: openclaw-session-123
spec:
  podTemplate:
    spec:
      runtimeClassName: kata-qemu
      containers:
      - name: openclaw-worker
        image: ghcr.io/example/openclaw-worker:latest
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "2"
            memory: "4Gi"
```

### Sandbox Technology Landscape

| Technology | Cold Start | Isolation | Python | Image Build |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Container (Docker) | ~50ms | Shared kernel | Full | Dockerfile |
| Firecracker microVM | ~125ms (+snapshot <1s) | Separate kernel | Full | ext4 rootfs |
| Kata Containers | ~125ms | Separate kernel | Full | OCI/Docker |
| WASM (monty) | 0.06ms | WASI | Limited | Custom |
| Unikernel (Unikraft) | <100ms | Minimal kernel | Improving | Custom |

The core tradeoffs analyzed by 高策 (gaocegege) in
<a href="https://gaocegege.com/Blog/genai/unikernel-agent">Agent sandbox
可能的选型以及 unikernel 的机会</a> (2026):

- **e2b** (<a href="https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b">GitHub</a>): Uses
  Firecracker microVMs. Templates are full VM snapshots that resume in under
  1 second (Intel <8ms, AMD <3ms). Image building converts Dockerfiles to
  ext4 rootfs. Uses a lightweight best-of-k scheduler rather than Kubernetes.
- **k7** (<a href="https://github.com/Katakate/k7">GitHub</a>): Uses Kata
  Containers with Firecracker VMM. Works directly with OCI/Docker images —
  no ext4 conversion. Integrates with Kubernetes/k3s. Kata's abstraction
  prevents direct use of Firecracker snapshots.
- **monty** (<a href="https://github.com/pydantic/monty">GitHub</a>): A
  WASM-based Python-subset interpreter achieving 0.06ms cold starts, but
  supports only a limited subset of Python (no `class`, limited stdlib).
- **Unikraft** (<a href="https://unikraft.org/">website</a>): Unikernel
  framework that compiles application + minimal kernel into a single image.
  Very small attack surface and fast startup. Added limited multi-process
  support in v0.19 (May 2025). Browser Use uses Unikraft microVMs in
  production for zero-secret agent isolation.

### Image Distribution Optimization

For large images, pulling is often the dominant latency source — not
container/VM startup itself. Modal's approach of **FUSE-based lazy loading**
serves files on-demand from a priority cache chain (memory → local SSD →
zone cache → CDN → object storage), dramatically cutting startup time.

estargz</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dragonflydb/dragonfly">Dragonfly</a>.

### Selection Guidance

For production AI-Infra platforms, avoid selecting a single "sandbox project"
without first deciding the layer boundary:

1. **Platform API**: choose OpenSandbox, CubeSandbox, E2B, Daytona, or
   Sandbox0 based on self-hosting, protocol compatibility, and licensing.
2. **Kubernetes API**: use `kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox` when the platform
   needs declarative lifecycle, warm pools, and stable sandbox identity.
3. **Runtime substrate**: use `agent-substrate/substrate` when many agents
   should exist dormantly and wake on invocation without one pod per agent.
4. **Runtime boundary**: map risk level to `RuntimeClass` or VM pools:
   gVisor for density, Kata for VM isolation, and dedicated VM/microVM pools
   for regulated tenants.
5. **Developer workstation**: evaluate Cleanroom or Brood Box separately from
   cluster sandboxes because local coding agents need repo diff review,
   credential forwarding, and deny-by-default egress policy.

The useful decision rule is: **OpenSandbox or CubeSandbox is a platform
choice; Agent Sandbox is a Kubernetes lifecycle choice; Agent Substrate is a
runtime-density choice; gVisor, Kata, nerdbox, and Firecracker are runtime
boundary choices**.
